description: "The Forme of Cury (Method of Cooking, cury being from Middle French\
  \ cuire: to cook) is an extensive collection of medieval English recipes of the\
  \ 14th century, in the form of a scroll. Its authors are given as \"the chief Master\
  \ Cooks of King Richard II\". The modern name was given to it by Samuel Pegge, who\
  \ published an edition of it in 1780 for the curator of the British Museum, Gustavus\
  \ Brander. This name has since come into usage for almost all versions of the original\
  \ manuscript. Along with Le Viandier, it is the best-known medieval guide to cooking.\n\
  The scroll was written in late Middle English (c. 1390) on vellum and details some\
  \ 205 recipes (although the exact number of recipes varies slightly between different\
  \ versions).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
